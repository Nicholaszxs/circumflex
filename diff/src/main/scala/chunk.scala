/*! # Chunks

Diff results are reported as a sequence of chunks. Each chunk defines
a correspondence between two sequences: `original` and `revised`.

`Chunk` is a sealed trait with only four implementations:

  * `InsertChunk` designates that elements have been added
    (the `original` sequence is empty);

  * `DeleteChunk` designates that elements have been removed
    (the `revised` sequence is empty);

  * `ChangeChunk` designates that elements have been changed;

  * `EqualChunk` designates that elements have not been changed
    (the two sequences are equal).
